"""Adapter suite: X reaches its measured capability with no credential.

The claim this module exists to defend is that a stale vendor identifier is
never silence. X rotates its GraphQL query ids per web release, and the id
sits in the request path, so a rotated id answers 404 — the same status a
missing page answers, and one status away from the 401/403 a blocked
operation answers. An adapter that read that 404 as "no results" would turn
a scheduled outage into an empty answer nobody could attribute, and one that
read it as `auth_required` would report a keyless route as credentialed.
findings.md §1 measured both halves: `SearchTimeline` and `TweetDetail`
returned 404 from stale ids while the three operations whose ids were current
returned 200, and a guest-blocked operation returns 403 or 401.

Every test here runs offline against fixtures under `fixtures/x/`.
