"""Transport seam: the sole owner of route constants and outbound requests.

Nothing outside this module may name a host, a path, or a vendor-published
public client credential. Callers that need to know whether a route is
reachable ask :func:`route_admissions`, which answers in booleans only.

This module also owns the captive-portal detector. Every response it returns
names the party that answered it — the origin, or a local network appliance —
so a caller can never record this network's block as a platform gap.

Reliability bar: read-only. The default opener refuses any URL that is not
``https://`` and any method that is not ``GET`` or ``HEAD``, so no code
path here can mutate a remote resource, and the offline ``fake`` route can
never leave the process.
